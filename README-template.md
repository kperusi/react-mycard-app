## Overview
This is a solution to the [Interactive card details form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw).
I have built this project using react as a javascript library. This an app where users can enter their details in a form and the details is shown on a card. The details are card number, customers name, date and cvc number.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

Via this project i have concrete my knowledge on react and css. in react, I can now manipulate states and passing props from child to a parent component which can also be then access by other components. In css I cemented my knowledge on responsive designs.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

More on responsive designs with css
css frame works
react context api
react lazy loading
react authentication
